ARTICLE TITLE:  Does Eye Color Depend on Gender?  It Might Depend on Who or How 

You Ask.

DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:  

Data on eye color and gender were collected from students enrolled in an introductory statistics 

course at a large university over a recent four year period. Biologically, eye color and gender are 

independent traits. However, in the data collected from our students, there is a statistically 

significant dependence between the two variables.



SOURCES:  	

Data were collected as a part of an opening course survey from students enrolled in an 

introductory statistics course at a large university over a recent four year period.



VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS: 

Data are comma delimited. Variables used in article are Gender (Female and Male) and Eye 

Color (Blue, Brown, Green, Hazel, Other). Other variables included in data set are: Age (in 

years); YearinSchool (First, Second, Third, Fourth, Other); Height (in inches); Miles (distance 

from home town of student to Ames, IA); Brothers (number of brothers); Sisters (number of 

sisters); CompTime (number of hours spent on computer per week); Exercise (whether the student 

exercises Yes or No); ExerTime (number of hours spent exercising per week); MusicCDs (number of 

music CDs student owns); PlayGames (number of hours spent playing games per week); WatchTV (number 

of hours spent watching TV per week).



STORY BEHIND THE DATA:  

In order to increase student interest and to obtain real data for use in the introductory statistics 

course, student level data, including eye color and gender, were collected as a part of an opening 

course survey. Biologically, gender and eye color are independent traits. However, in this 

population, the two variables are statistically dependent.



PEDAGOGICAL NOTES:

If treated as a representative sample from a larger population, this data set can be used to 

illustrate concepts such as conditional distributions, populations, samples and sampling 

variability, and tests of independence. Alternatively, considering the data as the population of 

interest, this example can be used to illustrate probability rules based on selecting a student at 

random from the population.
